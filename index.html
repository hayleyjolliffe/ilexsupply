    <!-- NAV BAR -->
        <nav id="topbar">
            This is the navbar. (Dead) Links will include: Logo (Home), Coffee, Merch, About, and Contact.
        <br><br><br>

    <!-- HERO -->
        <section id="hero">
            This is Section "Hero". This will be below the navbar, and will contain the hero image.
        <br><br><br>
        </section>

        <section id="shop">
            Scrolling down past the "Hero" section, we have the "Shop" section. This will contain the "Shop" header, along with the shop's items, their respective information, as well as the currency selector and filter selector.
        <br><br><br>
        </section>

        <section id="reviews">
            Then we get to the "Reviews" section, where there should be any reviews submitted for available products. Some will be hardcoded in for onload purposes.
            <div class="review">
                This is an example of a review. Layout will look something like this:
                <br><br>
                <b>Review Title</b><br>This is what I think of this item.<br>Item purchased: [ ITEM ]
            </div>
            <br><br><br>
        </section>

        <section id="cart">
            The cart section will display all items in the cart in order to review selections and proceed to checkout.
        <br><br><br>
        </section>

        <section id="checkout">
            The final section should be the checkout section. This will include all the necessary shipping information, order review, and calculate order total.
        <br><br><br>
        </section>

        <section>
            This is the test section. This is a <a>link</a>.
        </section>
